## Day 1

### Starting OpenLANE

For calling the tool, and put all the packages required for the flow, we run **inside the openlane folder** the following commands:

```python
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive 
package require openlane 0.9
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled.png)

### Basic folders and files

For this example, there will be used the design picorv32a. It can be found in the route openlane/designs/picorv32a

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%201.png)

- The src file is where all the Verilog files of our circuit will be stored

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%202.png)

- The config.tcl bypasses any configurations that has been already done

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%203.png)

<aside>
üìå The other .tcl files are the more detailed configuration files and has higher priority. We can‚Äôt run the flow without config.tcl

</aside>

### Preparing the design

‚Üí Now, we need to set a design to the flow in openlane, in this case, picorv32a

```python
prep -design picorv32a
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%204.png)

- After that, a folder of the synthesized design will be created in the runs folder

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%206.png)

<aside>
üìå the merged.lef file in tmp contains the needed information about the .tech and .ref. Also the parameters being taken by the run can be found in the config.tcl file in the synthesis/reports folder.

</aside>

### Running Synthesis & ABC

```python
run_synthesis
```

At the end of the process, we should get the message:

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%207.png)

### Characterize synthesis results

After synthesizing, we can get the results as for example, the area occupied by the chip:

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%208.png)

Also, we can find the total number of gates that the desing will use

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%209.png)

<aside>
üìå This report can be later be found in the .stat.rpt file located in reports/synthesis

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%2010.png)

</aside>

### FF Ratio

The **Flop Ratio** is the portions of D flip flops respect to the total number of cells. It can be calculated as:

$$
ffRatio = \frac{NumberOfFlipFlops}{NumberOfCells}
$$

For this example, taking the total number of cells (14876) and the total number of d flip flops (1613), we calculate the flop ratio as:

$$
ffRatio = \frac{1613}{14876} = 0,1084
$$


## Day 2

<aside>
üìå After making floorplanning, we first need to do the synthesis

</aside>

### Setting the ‚Äúswitches‚Äù

The first thing to do is to set the ‚Äúswitches‚Äù. Those switches are located in openlane/configuration. 

- You can find in the README file all the information about the variables needed for each step

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled.png)

- For setting those switches we to to the .tcl files in openlane/configuration

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%201.png)

![floorplan.tcl file](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%202.png)

floorplan.tcl file

<aside>
üìå in the OpenLANE flow, the vertical metal and the horizontal metal is one more than what is  specified. E.g If specified metal 4 it will be metal 5

</aside>

Those .tcl config files have parameters in common with other .tcl files. For that, OpenLANE has a series of priorities for each file. This order consists of (From higher to lower):

1. The file sky130A‚Ä¶.._config.tcl inside of any design
2. the config.tcl of any design
3. System defaults (floorplan.tcl)

### Running floorplan

```python
run_floorplan
```

At the end of the process, you should get the following messages:

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%203.png)

### Review floorplan files

- If we go to runs/X config.tcl we can find **all the parameters** that openlane used in the flow (including the ‚Äúswitches‚Äù mentioned before)

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%204.png)

- To see relevant information about the floorplanning we go to results/floorplan and then open the .def file. In this file, we can obtain the chip area

<aside>
üìå The units for the area used aren‚Äôt micros. It is necessary to perform a conversion from units to microns.

</aside>

### Floorplan in Magic

To open magic we use the following command in the /results/floorplan folder:

```python
magic -T /home/jhonstevenpintoh/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech leaf read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```

Then we can see the resulting floorplanning in magic:
