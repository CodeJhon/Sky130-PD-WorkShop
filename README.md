<aside>
‚öôÔ∏èReport from Jhon Pinto for the SkyWater130 Physical Design Workshop held in Aug 2 - 6

</aside>

## Day 1

### Starting OpenLANE

For calling the tool, and put all the packages required for the flow, we run **inside the openlane folder** the following commands:

```python
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive 
package require openlane 0.9
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled.png)

### Basic folders and files

For this example, there will be used the design picorv32a. It can be found in the route openlane/designs/picorv32a

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%201.png)

- The src file is where all the Verilog files of our circuit will be stored

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%202.png)

- The config.tcl bypasses any configurations that has been already done

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%203.png)

<aside>
üìå The other .tcl files are the more detailed configuration files and has higher priority. We can‚Äôt run the flow without config.tcl

</aside>

### Preparing the design

‚Üí Now, we need to set a design to the flow in openlane, in this case, picorv32a

```python
prep -design picorv32a
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%204.png)

- After that, a folder of the synthesized design will be created in the runs folder

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%206.png)

<aside>
üìå the merged.lef file in tmp contains the needed information about the .tech and .ref. Also the parameters being taken by the run can be found in the config.tcl file in the synthesis/reports folder.

</aside>

### Running Synthesis & ABC

```python
run_synthesis
```

At the end of the process, we should get the message:

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%207.png)

### Characterize synthesis results

After synthesizing, we can get the results as for example, the area occupied by the chip:

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%208.png)

Also, we can find the total number of gates that the desing will use

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%209.png)

<aside>
üìå This report can be later be found in the .stat.rpt file located in reports/synthesis

![Untitled](Day%201%20649c37faeca741a4aa844421c98653ef/Untitled%2010.png)

</aside>

### FF Ratio

The **Flop Ratio** is the portions of D flip flops respect to the total number of cells. It can be calculated as:

$$
ffRatio = \frac{NumberOfFlipFlops}{NumberOfCells}
$$

For this example, taking the total number of cells (14876) and the total number of d flip flops (1613), we calculate the flop ratio as:

$$
ffRatio = \frac{1613}{14876} = 0,1084
$$


## Day 2

<aside>
üìå After making floorplanning, we first need to do the synthesis

</aside>

### Setting the ‚Äúswitches‚Äù

The first thing to do is to set the ‚Äúswitches‚Äù. Those switches are located in openlane/configuration. 

- You can find in the README file all the information about the variables needed for each step

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled.png)

- For setting those switches we to to the .tcl files in openlane/configuration

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%201.png)

![floorplan.tcl file](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%202.png)

floorplan.tcl file

<aside>
üìå in the OpenLANE flow, the vertical metal and the horizontal metal is one more than what is  specified. E.g If specified metal 4 it will be metal 5

</aside>

Those .tcl config files have parameters in common with other .tcl files. For that, OpenLANE has a series of priorities for each file. This order consists of (From higher to lower):

1. The file sky130A‚Ä¶.._config.tcl inside of any design
2. the config.tcl of any design
3. System defaults (floorplan.tcl)

### Running floorplan

```python
run_floorplan
```

At the end of the process, you should get the following messages:

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%203.png)

### Review floorplan files

- If we go to runs/X config.tcl we can find **all the parameters** that openlane used in the flow (including the ‚Äúswitches‚Äù mentioned before)

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%204.png)

- To see relevant information about the floorplanning we go to results/floorplan and then open the .def file. In this file, we can obtain the chip area
    
    ![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%205.png)
    

<aside>
üìå The units for the area used aren‚Äôt micros. It is necessary to perform a conversion from units to microns.

</aside>

### Floorplan in Magic

To open magic we use the following command in the /results/floorplan folder:

```python
magic -T /home/jhonstevenpintoh/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech leaf read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```

Then we can see the resulting floorplanning in magic:

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%206.png)

### Placement using RePlAce

<aside>
üìå OpenLane uses HPWL to do Placement.

</aside>

<aside>
üìå Placement goes in two stages: the global placement and the detailed placement. Legalization occurs in Detail placement. Legality is the rules used to place STD cells. For example, there should be no overlaps.

</aside>

- After obtaining the floorplan we run placement:

```python
run_placement
```

After the run, a placement analysis is obtained and we can see that the placement is legalized.

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%207.png)

- Now, to see how our design is after placement, we go to the folder results/placement and run the following command:

```python
magic -T /home/jhonstevenpintoh/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech leaf read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &
```

Here we can see that the power network was made in this step, not in the floorplan stage

![Untitled](Day%202%20ec8488d7a7634fb4b1164e6d91da0f45/Untitled%208.png)


## Day 3

### Making changes

There is an option to make changes on some steps on the flow. For this example, we are going to change the I/O pins distribution in the floorplan.

For doing that we go to openlane/configuration and we open the floorplan.tcl to check the variables involved in the config. After selecting the variable we are going to set, we run:

```python
set ::env(FP_IO_MODE) 2
run_floorplan
```

### Cloning vsd std cell design

For cloning the repo for designing our std cell, we run in the openlane folder:

```python
git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign
```

Now, we need to paste the tech file from magic. That file is located in openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic. We need to copy the [sky130A.tech](http://sky130A.tech) file

```python
cp sky130A.tech [Location]
```

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled.png)

Now, to see the std cell in magic, we launch the following command:

```python
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &
```

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%201.png)

<aside>
üìå A std cell in LEF format contains information about available metal layer.

</aside>

### Layers in Magic

The layers are distributed at the right side. If we select a portion and write ‚Äúand‚Äù on the terminal, we can see the material of a determined layer

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%202.png)

### DRC errors

When violating the DRC errors from the pdk, the layer will be highlighted in white

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%203.png)

If we would want to know what DRC rule was violate, go to the option DRC ‚Üí Find next error and check de terminal for the reason of the error

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%204.png)

### Extracting the Spice circuit

<aside>
üìå All the commands will be executed on the magic terminal

</aside>

First, we need to create an extraction file (EHD file)

```python
extract all
```

Now, we need to take that extracted file an take it into spice. Run the command to obtain parasitic capacitances:

```python
ext2spice cthresh 0 rthresh 0
ext2spice
```

Now, inside this folder we open the spice file with VIM

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%206.png)

### Check the scale

With the minimum distance set by the magic layout, check the option of scale. If its not the same, change it

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%207.png)

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%208.png)

### Defining Va and Vdd + Fixing errors

<aside>
üìå Esc+:wq! for getting out of VIM

</aside>

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%209.png)

### Simulating in ngspice

In the vds‚Ä¶design folder, execute:

```python
ngspice sky130_inv.spice
```

Obtaining the following results:

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%2010.png)

### Plot in ngspice

We run into ngspice: (where a means the input)

```python
plot y vs time a
```

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%2011.png)

### Characterizing the cell

For characterizing, it means to find 4 parameters:

- Rise transition / Fall transition
- Rise cell delay / Fall cell delay

![Untitled](Day%203%203ed60a259c514fdebb0441860a52f150/Untitled%2012.png)

$$
RiseCellDelay = 4.0528ns-4.05ns = 2.82ps
$$


## Day 4

<aside>
üìå For the PnR tool, the only thing needed is the boundary, the power and the ground rails and the input and output pins.

</aside>

### Information about the tracks

For info about the tracks and pitch dimensions, go to the folder pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130_fd_sc_hd and open the file tracks.info

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled.png)

### Checking the pin distribution

To confirm if the pins are located at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical tracks, we run at the magic terminal the following command:

```python
grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%201.png)

<aside>
üìå Here we can confirm that the pins are located at those intersections

</aside>

### Creating the ports

For creating the ports we go to Edit‚Üí Text and after selecting the port, define the tab as follows:

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%202.png)

### Setting port class and port use attributes

In this part we ‚Äútell‚Äù the program what port is vdd what port is the input and so on. For that we use the following commands:

```python
what
port class [inout/input/output]
port use [ground/power/signal]
```

<aside>
üìå The type of the command depends on the type of the port

</aside>

### Extracting the LEF file

For creating a copy of our principal mag file, we run the command in the magic terminal:

```python
save [name].mag
```

After opening the copy, create the lef file with:

```python
lef write
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%203.png)

### Copying the custom cell and characterization files into the OpenLANE flow

in the /openlane/vsdstdcelldesign/ copy the following files:

```python
cp sky130_vsdinv.lef /home/USER/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/
```

Also in /openlane/vsdstdcelldesign/libs copy the following files

```python
cp sky130_fd_sc_hd__* /home/USER/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/
```

### Set the config.tcl file

Now, we need to configure the config.tcl file in the picorv32 folder

```python
vim config.tcl
```

```python
set ::env(LIB_SYNTH) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hdtypical.lib"
set ::env(LIB_FASTEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hdfast.lib"
set ::env(LIB_SLOWEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hdslow.lib"
set ::env(LIB_TYPICAL) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hdtypical.lib"

set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS) [glob $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/src/*.lef]
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%204.png)

### Invoke OpenLANE with a specific run

- Launch openlane (if you don‚Äôt have it launched already)

```python
docker

./flow.tcl -interactive

package require openlane 0.9

prep -design picorv32a -tag [tag] -overwrite

set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]

add_lefs -src $lefs

run_synthesis
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%206.png)

### Fixing slack violations

- First, we fix manually the variables which has to be:

```python
echo $::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY)

set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) 1

echo $::env(SYNTH_BUFFERING)

echo $::env(SYNTH_SIZING)

set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

echo $::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%207.png)

- now we run again the synthesis, floorplan and placement

```python
run_synthesis

init_floorplan

place_io

global_placement_or

detailed_placement

tap_decap_or

detailed_placement
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%208.png)

### Check the new std cells in the placement

Running the .mag file of the placement results we can see that the std cells were succesfully placed

```python
magic -T /home/**USER**/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%209.png)

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%2010.png)

### Editing sta config file

Now, in the /openlane/ folder, we edit:

```python
vim sta.conf
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%2011.png)

### Editing sta config file

In the /picorv32a/src/ folder, we modify the sta.conf file as follows:

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%2012.png)

### Run sta.conf

In the openlane folder we run:

```python
sta sta.conf
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%2013.png)

### Run Clock Tree Synthesis

In the terminal from openlane, run:

```python
run_cts
```

![Untitled](Day%204%20cfb17cb0b93b48779f582ffd7ef976ba/Untitled%2014.png)


## Day 5

### Launch OpenLANE

<aside>
üìå If you have it already open, close it and launch it again

</aside>

```python
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
prep -design picorv32a -tag [tag]
```

![Untitled](Day%205%201577ed4f69ea4078b6e5fd853f02bd0b/Untitled.png)

### Generate the Power Distribution Network

Then, in the same terminal, run:

```python
gen_pdn
```

![Untitled](Day%205%201577ed4f69ea4078b6e5fd853f02bd0b/Untitled%201.png)

### Running routing

Finally, we run the placement command in the openlane terminal:

```python
run_routing
```

<aside>
üìå If there is any DRC violations, we will have to correct them manually

</aside>
